- **Next.js**: A React framework that provides server-side rendering and static site generation, enhancing performance and scalability.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that ensures strong typing, improving code quality and maintainability.

### 2. **Collaboration and Real-Time Editing**
